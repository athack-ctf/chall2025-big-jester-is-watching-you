  Somewhere near the admins, Jester is watching. Everyone. Everything.
  He will give you a gift, if you show him where to send it...

  **NOTE**: you'll have to go to the hardware village (MB 3rd), where Jester is sitting. Ask our volunteers if you're
  not sure where it is.

  ## About **Big Jester**
  At @Hack 2025, Big Jester featured a mysterious box with an all-seeing eye (just a cheap webcam).
  We're sharing it - along with the included picture - as a fun throwback. However, since it only requires a webcam,
  you can try running it locally using the source code available in
  [challenge's public repo](https://github.com/athack-ctf/chall2025-big-jester-is-watching-you/tree/main/source).
